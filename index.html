                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                            <p>Originally a Scottish last name. In Gaelic, it means "comely." It can also mean "child of the wise leader" and "born of fire." It's used as both a boys' and a girls' name but is more popular for girls.Mackenzie is one of the prettiest names you can give a little girl.I think the name Mackenzie is great for a girl. Using the reason that it is supposed to be a boys name doesn't work. How many names do we hear everyday that we think of that were originally one gender and now more often used for the other. Kelly for instance is more common for a girl now but it was originally a boys name, also several names that go both ways. When I think of Mackenzie I think of someone who is playful and fun to be around.The name's development was also influenced by Cainnech, meaning "good-looking".</p>
